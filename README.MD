# Dingo's TLDR Bot

Creates Too Long Didn't Reads from discord chats using the power of text summarization models  

## Why?

fuck you that's why :fu: :grinning:  

## Installation

Required to be run on a Linux based machine due to `bitsandbytes` being used.  
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
then you can run `app.py` to start the bot  

Or just run it in a Docker container ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯  

## Notes

The actual TLDR AI fun part was ripped out and put into it's own file since the original purpose of the bot got removed.  
Alembic was going to be used for database migrations but I just modified the database directly using DataGrip instead.
